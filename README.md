# Dotfiles

This repository is mean to hold all the configurations that I use and would like to keep using

Some of the stuff I use that this configuration contains:

- Brewfile
- Fish Shell
  - Oh My Fish
  - Starship.rs
- Neovim
- Zsh & Oh My Zsh

### Brewfile

The easiest way to manage all the packages and applications that I need to use on macOS

### Fish

Fish is not a Bourne shell, but is very nice to use

I use [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) as my package manager, with some nice plugins (like bass and fish.nvm)

I also have a custom configuration for Starship.rs, to make it look more like [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

### Neovim

My Neovim configuration is written in Lua. I use [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as my package manager for Neovim, as well as Mason to handle configuration of my various LSPs and linters.

### Zsh

Zsh is the default shell on macOS. It's ok.

### Other

There is a bash script that I can run to set this up automatically
